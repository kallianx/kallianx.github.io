>## Where are we?

Here lies a blog of mine that started as a school assignment, but I guess I got a bit too intimate with the coding, customizing, content creation, etc., beyond the point of no return.<br>
Now, this blog has become my problem, and I'm living the glitch, embracing the chaos.

>## Who am I?

I'm a 99% introverted INTJ electronic wraith who is owned by an Abyssinian cat.<br>
A long time gamer, playing Pokemon in a Gameboy pocket without knowing any Japanese, so pass the game by talking with every single NPC in the game at the age of 8.<br>
A beginner drummer, happy to finally find an activity that can put my restless head in a flow state. My somehow broken brain doesn't leave me alone even when I'm doing a 100m sprint. Now I just need to have my electric drum kit.<br>

**Other small things about me**
- First console: PlayStation 4
- Favourite games: (I really can't pick between these two)<br>
Dragon Age: Origins<br>
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty
- Favourite game series: Dragon Age
- First platinum trophy: Bloodborne
- Most played game series: Assassin's Creed<br>

>## About my cat

Dobby was born around March 26, 2021. She is a blue Abyssinian with an elegant, powerful body and heavenly soft fur. She is my first and only chosen family member; we belong each other. I hope she loves me as I do her, just perhaps with more hugs and nuzzles and fewer scratches and bites.<br>
Dobby is now with my parents in my homeland and I miss her every night when I'm alone in bed, and I'm waiting for the day we can be together again.<br>
