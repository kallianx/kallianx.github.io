>#### Media Convergence
How does your website bring different media forms/modes together?

Mayer (2009) emphasised in the 'modality principle' of multimedia learning that combining visual and auditory information can facilitate cognitive processing and improve learning outcomes. I use video, audio, images and text on the website to integrate different media forms and modes. For example, the Bound by Royalty-free page combines text with video. I believe that presenting content in this way not only helps to attract audiences' attention, but also helps them to understand the content more deeply, creating a more immersive experience of receiving information.
In addition, according to various studies on how media modes affect audiences' comprehension and memory, when audiences are exposed to different sensory information at the same time, their memory and comprehension abilities are significantly improved. This method effectively reduces cognitive overload. Through the interaction of images and sound, audiences can more easily grasp key points. Multi-sensory integration is based on Mayer's multimedia principle, which has proven effective in facilitating audience learning and information processing.
The theory of 'multimodal discourse' proposed by Kress and van Leeuwen (2001) suggests that the integration of visual and textual elements enriches the process of content meaning formation. Therefore, on the 'Photos Been There' page, which mainly displays images, I also added relevant information such as the title of the photo, the equipment used to take it, and the settings in text form. This integration not only enhances understanding and enriches the images but also helps audiences participate in the content from different cognitive levels. audiences can not only view images but also learn additional technical details, such as equipment information and settings. This kind of in-depth information can better stimulate audience interest. In the digital age, the integration of various media forms has become increasingly important. I believe that information transfer in modern society is no longer based on text alone. For example, the popularity of memes and short videos shows that images and videos have become an important part of expression and communication. Therefore, I believe that integrating these elements enhances both the comprehensibility and appeal of the content. In this way, audiences can not only understand the content better but also learn relevant knowledge and skills in a subtle way
According to the concept of transmedia storytelling proposed by Jenkins (2006), different media platforms provide audiences with unique content experiences rather than simply repeating content, which can enhance audience participation and deepen the overall content. For this reason, I have improved the interactivity of cross-platform content and enhanced the audience experience by embedding content from different social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube and Bilibili on the website. By embedding dynamic, real-time content from social media platforms, audiences can engage with the content more immediately and interactively, thereby deepening the relationship between the audience and the content. In the context of social media, audiences are not only consumers of content, but also producers and distributors. Therefore, embedding social media content in the website can effectively enhance audience participation and foster a more engaged community.

>#### Platforms
What platforms have you made use of in making your media and building your website? Discuss your workflow/s and what works and doesn't work.

I chose Jekyll and GitHub Pages for the website and Davinci Resolve and GarageBand for the media production. This choice was made after a comparative analysis of several platforms and tools, combined with my personal needs and creative process.
Bin Uzayr (2022) points out that "A couple of popular ways that a beginner should be able to utilize to create a free as well as a simple website are GitHub and WordPress" (p. 55). Before I decided to use GitHub Pages, I knew about WordPress, which is also free. For a personal blog site, WordPress is too big and bloated, and you have to buy a paid domain name from a third party. These two major drawbacks immediately led me to abandon WordPress and turn to the combination of static website generators and GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a free hosting service platform based on GitHub. It has good version control features, a simple and nice interface, and offers free github.io subdomains. It also allows users to use third party domain names. This is a very useful and practical feature for me. After choosing GitHub Pages as my hosting platform, I researched and compared the three most popular free static website generators, Hugo, Hexo and Jekyll, and finally settled on Jekyll. Firstly, Pipinellis (2018) points out that "GitHub Pages uses Jekyll, which is a static-site generator written in Ruby, and is among the top open source static-site generators (https://www.staticgen.com/)."(p. 5). Secondly, in terms of the two most important aspects, template types and tutorial guidance, Jekyll has a rich variety of templates and strong community support, which is also the main reason why I ultimately chose Jekyll.
DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, GarageBand and Audition are all excellent tools for creating media content. I chose DaVinci Resolve because the basic version is fully functional and completely free for individual users, whereas Adobe Premiere Pro requires a subscription. And since Adobe Audition also requires a subscription, I decided to try GarageBand, which is free within the Apple ecosystem.
Before starting my blog, the content I created was mainly published on various social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube and Bilibili. Tonta (2009) pointed out that "These sites, which are considered as social networks, are used for socializing, having fun, accessing information, learning and doing professional work" (p. 742). After establishing my personal blog, I will continue to publish my work on social media platforms, but I will publish it in my blog in an embedded form as a means of integrating, storing and classifying my work.
In terms of workflow, after inspiration, I will first use text tools to capture creative ideas, while collecting materials online and organizing and archiving them on my NAS (Network Attached Storage).  When the script is relatively complete, I will use the appropriate media production software to produce it according to the content form. After the media production is completed, the project files are backed up to the NAS using the automatic synchronization software, and then the works are published to the appropriate social media platforms. Finally, the content that has been successfully published on the social media platform is embedded into the blog, and Jekyll is used to create the new content page and upload it to GitHub. This is currently a successful, efficient and relatively stable workflow for me.

>#### Data
How and where have you stored the data that's displayed on your website? Which encodings (audio, text, video, image) are used in the presentation of your media to your audience? Reflect on the open/closed nature of the data and/or web pages that you've constructed here with reference to notions of platform capitalism and open-source data.

Coughlin pointed out that “Cloud storage is the repository of much consumer data. For instance, many consumers keep their photos in the cloud. However, having a local copy of data provides additional protection of that data and allows faster access to mission critical data or access to data when the external network is unavailable.” (p. 187) I agree with this view, so my website's code and data use a combination of cloud and local storage. The latest versions are stored on the hosting site's GitHub pages and the local hard drive, and each major version is backed up separately to the NAS (Network Attached Storage).
The video media displayed to the audience uses the FHD Mp4 format encoded in H.264. The video is currently hosted directly on the website. As the hosting platform GitHub Pages limits the uploaded file to less than 100MB, the video file exceeding 100MB has to be compressed to less than 100MB using x264 encoding. However, the plan is for the subsequent video content to be uploaded to YouTube and Bilibili first, and then published to the blog via embedding, so the subsequent videos do not need to be compressed separately for display on the blog.
Audio files are in MP3 format with a bit rate of 192kbps, which guarantees sound quality and minimises file size.
Images are displayed on the website in two forms: one is saved directly on the website and the other is published on Instagram and then embedded in the blog. They can currently be found on the Images page. In the future, it is planned to display them on pages according to the type, nature or theme of the images.
The text on the site is mainly written and displayed in Markdown and HTML. There is currently no need for other display features, and this form of text display should continue.
From the perspective of platform capitalism and open-source data concepts, my site should be in a relatively middle ground, as it is primarily hosted on the GitHub platform. As Srnicek points out, “The platform, on the other hand, has data extraction built into its DNA,” (p. 40). Although GitHub is a platform with open source at its core, it is undeniably a subsidiary of Microsoft, one of the giants of capital. Although the content of the site is currently licensed under CC BY 4.0, if other factors arise in the future, I will also change the licence applicable to certain content accordingly. Furthermore, as I choose to display certain content by embedding social media platforms, this content is inevitably exploited by platform capitalism. Therefore, I think that my website is both limited and to some extent closed by the mainstream capitalist platform, but also because of its openness, accessibility and transparency, according to OKF's definition of open data,  “Open data and content can be freely used, changed, and shared by everyone for any purpose.”(Ates et al., 2023, p. 88), so the website has a certain degree of openness.
